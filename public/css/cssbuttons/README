These buttons are made to be easy to use.

This is the website where I found them: http://devgrow.com/super-simple-css-buttons

The usage is pretty straight forward, add the class "button" to pretty much any element you can possibly think.

After that, you can control the colors and size by using combinations like this:

<a href='http://google.com/' class='button'>Google</a>
<a href='http://bing.com/' class='button red'>Bing</a>
<a href='http://devgrow.com/' class='button large green'>DevGrow</a>
